# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Window drops: a web canvas per car and window material, drops land, merge, run, are pushed by speed and G-force and swept by the wipers; size and density follow the rain.
- Driver's view: the drops are drawn over the windscreen (game web UI layer) as lenses with thin wobbling streaks, clipped to the windscreen's outline, wiper arcs that clear and refill, 30 frames a second at most. Switch: `windscreen.overlay`; `tuneScreen(size)`.
- Drops running over the paint (same canvas as the scratches), driven by gravity, G-force and wind.
- Dirt in four kinds (dust, mud, tyre rubber, road grime) built from what the wheels report, washed by rain, water and car washes.
- Scratches and wheel-arch dirt splats (the hi-fi engine of Enhanced Skid Marks, ported).
- Options page group "Car Surface FX" (Graphics) with live settings.
- API version 2 for other mods: `wash`, `repair`, `puddle`, `getState`/`setState`, `level`.
- Safety: the update loop is wrapped, one error switches the mod off and restores everything.

## 0.1.0

- Wet paint with beads, five wetness levels, drying.
